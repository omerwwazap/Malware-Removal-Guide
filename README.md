# Malware-Removal-Guide

Made this because for some reason lots of friends were asking about Virus/Malware removal, so this is a small guide to help them out.

## Disclaimer

- The following instructions are recommendations only.
- Give Windows Defender a try as your main Anti-Virus program,
    - It is more than adequate for consumers.
    - Much better than running a free AV suite that is of lesser quality or plans to sell your personal habits for profit (MCafee, Avast, AVG, etc)

## Pre-requisites for These to Work

- System that successfully boots
- **Do NOT use this guide if your system has a form of malware that encrypts your files**
  - For that go [here](#for-ransomware-type-malware-to-do) but it will be better if you contact a professional.
- **For Windows only**
- All tools should be run in Normal Mode (not Safe Mode) unless you are unable to boot Normal Mode, or if the scans fails in Normal Mode.
- All tools must be run under an Administrator account.
- **Before you start** go into your browserâ€™s extensions and remove all suspicious items' if there are any.
- **Before you start** remove any default search providers and unusual homepage, if there are any.

## Tools to Run

1. Download and run [rkill](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/rkill/dl/10/)
   1. Could take a couple minutes to run.
