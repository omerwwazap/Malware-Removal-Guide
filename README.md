## Disclaimer

- The following instructions are recommendations only.
- Give Windows Defender a try as your main Anti-Virus program;
  - It is more than adequate for consumers.
    - Much better than running a free AV suite that is of lesser quality or plans to sell your personal habits for profit (MCafee, Avast, AVG, etc)
- **For Windows only**

## Pre-requisites for These to Work

- System that successfully boots.
- **Do NOT use this guide if your system has a form of malware that encrypts your files.**
  - For that go [here](#for-ransomware-type-malware-to-do) but it will be better if you contact a professional.
- All tools should be run in Normal Mode (not Safe Mode) unless you are unable to boot Normal Mode, or if the scans fails in Normal Mode.
- All tools must be run under an Administrator account.
- Browser Related - **Before you start**
  - Go into your browserâ€™s extensions and remove all suspicious items, if there are any.

   2. What it does;
      - Removes the vast majority of infections.
      - Has built-in repair tools to fix damage done by malware.
